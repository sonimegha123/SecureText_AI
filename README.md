# SecureText_AI

RAG with Sensitive Data Protection  
This project leverages Gradio and Presidio to create a web application for handling sensitive documents securely. The application can anonymize personal identifiable information (PII) within documents and provide answers to questions based on anonymized content. It also supports deanonymization to restore original information when needed, ensuring data privacy while maintaining functionality.

#Features:  

Document Anonymization: Automatically identifies and anonymizes sensitive information such as names, dates, credit card numbers, and more.  
Question Answering: Retrieves context-based answers from anonymized documents.  
Deanonymization: Restores anonymized data to its original form when necessary.  
User-Friendly Interface: Simple, interactive web interface built with Gradio.
